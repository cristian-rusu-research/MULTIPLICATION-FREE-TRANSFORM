--------------------------------

This package contains proof-of-concept source code for the results presented in: Learning multiplication-free linear transformations, C. Rusu, 2018

This software is released under the MIT license.
Tested on Matlab R2012a.
For problems, bug reports, comments and other contact C. Rusu.

--------------------------------

Starting points:

test.m - Tests the B-DLA, M-DLA, M-DLA-greedy, B4x4-DLA and S-DLA algorithms on image data.

--------------------------------

This package uses (and contains) the weighted maximum matching algorithm in general graphs:

OMPToolbox

This package uses the OMP-Box v10 
(http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ronrubin/software.html).
All credits and thanks go to the creator of OMP-Box, Ron Rubinstein.
To ease the use of this package, the toolbox comes pre-compiled on Win32 or Win64. Recompile if needed.

Visit the home webpage of the toolbox to get the lastest version or if problems.
